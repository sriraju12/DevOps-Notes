Note:
     To move into different file directories
     1.pwd ->present working directory (current folder)
     2.cd /c/vagrantvms -> this will move into the vagrantvms folder
     3. cd .. -> this will come to the previous folder (i.e c folder)
     4. mkdir centos -> this will create a folder called centos

Some important directories in linux:
                                     1.Home Directories -> /root for root user home directory
                                                           /home/username for normal user home directory
                  
                                     2.User Executables -> /bin the commmand that we run
                                                            like ls,pwd are present here (store here)

Linux:

     Basic Commands:
                    1.whoami -> to see what type of user you are(root user or normal user)
                    2.pwd -> to see the present working directory(current path)
                    3.ls -> to see the files in current folder
                    4.cat /etc/os-release -> to see which operating system we are using and its version. 
                    5.cd / -> means root directory(in this directory all the directories(folders) are present)
                    5.cd /root -> root user directory
                    6.cd or cd ~ -> whenever you want to come to home directory.
                    7.touch touchfile1.txt -> touch command is used to create the empty file
                    8.touch devopsfile{1..10}.txt ->it will create the 10 devops file(like devops1,devops2..devops10)
                    9.cp devopsfile1.txt dev/ -> it will copy the devopsfile1.txt file to dev folder(here source is devopsfile1 and destination is dev folder)
                    10.cp -r dev backup/ -> This is used to copy the entire directory or folder to another directory(source is dev and destination is backup)
                    11.mv devopsfile3.txt ops/ -> this is used to move the file or folder to another folder(source is devopsfile3.txt and destination is ops)
                    12.mv ops dev/ ->here we are moving entire ops directory or folder into dev directory(source is ops and destination is dev).
                    13.mv devopsfile2.txt devopsfile22.txt -> this rename the file name from devopsfile2.txt to devopsfile22.txt.
                    14.mv *.txt dev/ -> this command is used to move the all files that ends with .txt will be moved into the dev directory
                    15.rm devopsfile2.txt -> it will remove that file(only files not folder)
                    16.rm -r dev -> this will remove the entire folder.
                    17.rm -rf * -> it will remove the all the files from the current working directory
                    18.ip addr show -> to show the ip address 
                    

Note:
     1.absolute path means complete path of that directory or folder.
     2.relative path means just that directory or folder name 
     3.sudo yum install vim -y -> to install vim editor in linux(centos machines).

vim editor:
           It has three modes: 
                               1.command mode
                               2.insert mode(edit mode we can edit changes in this mode) i.e click i to enter into the edit mode
                               3.extended mode(if you want to do more operations like save or quit from vim editor) i.e : is used to extended mode like :w to save and :q to quit

By default it will in command mode.
if you are in insert mode you want to come back to command mode use esc key.

vim devopsfile1.txt -> this command is used to enter into vim editor and we can make changes in the file.
cat devopsfile1.txt -> this is used to print the content that is present in the file.
:q! -> this is forcefully quitting from the vim editor without saving the changes.
:wq -> this will save the content and quit from vim editor.
cat command is used to print the content.
:se nu -> in vim editor to see the numbering for the lines. 

Note:
      while working with directories or folder(like move,copy, delete, cd, operations):

      1.if you are in same directory then file name is enough.
      2.if you are in different directory and trying to do operations in different directory
        you need to give absolute path(complete path).


vim editor shortcuts:
                      1.gg -> to move from last line to first line
                      2.G -> to move from first line to last line
                      3.yy -> to copy single line
                      4.p -> small p (p) paste the line below and captial p (P) paste the line above.
                      5.4yy -> to copy multiple line(4 lines)
                      6.dd -> to delete the single line
                      7. u -> to undo
                      8.5dd -> to delete 5 lines 
                      9./anything -> to search the content 

To do any operation you should be in command mode.

Types of files in Linux:
                         1.- is for regular files
                         2.d is for directory
                         3.l is for link
                        
1.ls -lt -> it will sort latest one to first according to the time stamp.
2.ls -ltr -> it will sort the latest one to the bottom
3.vim /etc/hostname -> By this we can change the hostname after that we need to run another command -> hostname typehostname
4.file filename -> this command is used to check the type of file


Filters:
        1.grep -> This command is used to search the content in a file
                   i.e grep firewall anaconda-ks.cfg

                  In this firewall is word to be search in anaconda-ks.cfg file.


Note:
     1. In Linux,everything is case-sensitive.

     2.If you want to search anything in a file without case-sensitive use -i in above
       i.e grep -i firewall anaconda-ks.cfg.here i indicates without case-sensitive. 

     3.If you want to search anything in the current directory use -> grep -i firewall *
       it will search only files not directories (folder).

     4.If you want to search anything in the current directory irrespect of files and folders
       use -> grep -iR firewall *.this -R indicate that search in both files and directories. 

     5.If you dont want to search for that particular word (show content except this word)
       use -> grep -vi firewall *.this -v indicates show content except this word.


2.less commmand -> This is used to print the content just like cat command but 
                    only difference is it looks like vim editor.we can search content etc.
                    use -> less anaconda-ks.cfg

3.more command -> This is just like less command only difference is, in less command you can move
                  the content using up and down arrow and in more you should use enter button.
                  Content percentage also it will show. use -> more anaconda-ks.cfg

4.head command -> if you want to see first 10 lines of the file use -> head anaconda-ks.cfg.
                                          or
                  if you want to use first 20 lines use -> head -20 anaconda-ks.cfg

5.tail command -> if you want to see last 10 lines use -> tail anaconda-ks.cfg
                                      or
                  if you want to use last 20 lines use -> tail -20 anaconda-ks.cfg

6.cut command -> if you want to filter username or anything based on delimiter
                 use -> cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd.here f1 is column one and : is delimiter.

7.if you want any thing to search and replace the word:
                                                         2 ways

                 1.using vm editor (in extended mode) -> %s/coronavirus/covid19
                   this will replace one time in single line. 
 
                   if cornovirus word present in more than one time in the same line then use -> %s/coronavirus/covid19/g 
                
                2.sed command -> sed -i 's/coronavirus/covid/g' samplefile.txt


I/O Redirections:
                  i/o redirection means input/output is redirect to some files rather than showing on the screen.

                  1. > -> this is the symbol for output redirection.
                  2. < -> this is the symbol for input redirection. 
                  3. If you don't want to override the content i.e just append(add) use -> >>
                  4. if you want to redirect the error messages to a file(you don't want to display error messages on screen) -> rcho hi 2> errorfile 
                  
echo -> this command is used to print content what ever we give( echo "hello" -> it will print hello).


   standard input(1)   
           ------> |---------------------- ---------->standard output(1)
                   |       command       |
                   |---------------------- ---------->standard error(2)

* command > output.txt 2> error.txt -> if you execute the command and we want to redirect to the file and if the command throws a error message then
                                       we want to redirect to a file.

* command < input.txt > output.txt -> here we are taking the input from the input.txt file and redirecting the output to a output.txt file.
  cat < input.txt > output.txt

* command < input.txt > output.txt 2> errorfile.txt ->  here we are taking the input from the input.txt file and redirecting the output to a 
                                                        output.txt file and if any error will occur then it will redirect to a errorfile.txt file.

Piping:
       1.You can use the wc command to count a file's word, line, character, or byte count.
       2. wc -l /etc/passwd -> wc -l is used to count no.of lines in a file  or folders in directory.
       3. ls | wc -l -> here ls gives output and pipe takes that output as input to the wc -l command and print
          the total no.of lines
       4. head anaconda-ks.cfg | grep by -> here head anaconda-ks.cfg will print first 10 lines as output
          the pipe takes that output as input and grep is used for searching it will search for by and 
          it will print the output.

find command -> This command is used to locate or search for the files i.e find /etc -name host*
                here /etc is the path and -name is search by name and host* is that starts with.



Users and Groups:
                  users is of three types: 
                                           1.root
                                           2.regular
                                           3.service(no login)

         
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash -> here root is username,x is shadow encrypted password,0 is userid,0 is groupid
                                   root is comment,/root is home directory,/bin/bash is login shell.

1.adduser username -> This command is used to add the user.
2.groupadd groupname -> This command is used to add the group.
3.passwd ansible(here ansible is the username) -> This command is used to reset or set the password for user.
4.su - ansible(username) -> This command is used to switch from one user to another user.
5.userdel aws(username) -> This command is used to delete the user but still home directoy is present,
                           if you want to delete user with home directory use -> userdel -r aws.
6.groupdel devops(groupname) -> This command is used to delete the group..
                           

If you want to add users to the group they are two ways:
                                                         1.usermod -aG devops ansible
                        (here -aG is the supplementory group , devops is groupname and ansible user).

                                                         2.vim editor(just edit the file and add name in the group).


File Permissions:
                 In this first character is file type,next three is for user,next three is for group,last three is
                 for others.

                 -rw-------. 1 root root 2026 Feb 16 07:21 anaconda-ks.cfg
                 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root   37 Feb 16 07:35 cmds -> /opt/dev/ops/devops/test/commands.txt
                 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root   94 Feb 18 05:55 example.txt
                 -rw-------. 1 root root 1388 Feb  5 15:50 original-ks.cfg
                 drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root    6 Feb 18 05:53 redir


here d -> file type
rwx -> user                        r -> read, w -> write, x -> execute
r-x -> group
r-x -> other

1.To change the ownership and group of the file use -> chown ansible(username):devops(group) redir(filename)

   if you want to change only ownership of a file -> chown ansible(username) redir(filename)

2.To change the read,write and execute permissions for others use -> chmod o-x redir(filename)
  (here o is others amd redir is filename)

                drw-r--r-x. 2 jenkins devops 25 Feb 18 08:20 redir

3.To change the read,write and execute permissions for group use -> chmod g+r redir(filename)
  (here it will add read permissions)

                                    or


Change Permissions using numeric methods:
                                         4(for read r)
                                         2(for write w)
                                         1(for execute x)


drw-r--r-x. 2 jenkins devops 25 Feb 18 08:20 redir

to change permissions,for user and group full acess and others no acess use -> chmod 770 redir(filename).
(here 1st digit for user, 2nd digit for group and last digit for others).



Services:
         services that are running in our machine and know their status.

         1.systemctl status httpd -> To see the status whether it is active or not.  i.e here httpd is the service
         2.systemctl start httpd -> To start the service
         3.systemctl stop httpd -> To stop the service                                           
         4.systemctl restart httpd ->To restart the service
         5.systemctl reload httpd ->To reload the changes without even restarting it.
         6.systemctl enable httpd -> modifies the service configuration to tell systemd that the service needs to start up automatically on boot.

provising -> provising in vagrant means executing script or commands when vm is up.
provising executes only one time.

Steps to deploy website manually:
                                 1.first install the dependencies.
                                 2.start the server(using systemctl)
                                 3.manage the configurations if needed
                                 4.deploy the website(download the website and unzip it and restart the server)

Note:
     tooplate.com -> ready-made static websites are available.

Steps to deploy website automatically:
                                       1.In vagrantfile add the provising(scripts or commands)then everything get ready.
